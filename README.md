# Sweet Desserts iOS App

This is a simple iOS app (for now) that I built with SwiftUI that allows you to explore a list of delicious desserts, log in, and save your favorite desserts. The app serves as a playground for me to play around, learn and experiment with SwiftUI concepts and implementing various features.

## Features

- **Dessert List**: Browse through a collection of desserts. Each dessert is displayed with its name, description, price and an appetizing image (more info to add in the future).

- **User Authentication**: Log in to the app using your credentials to access personalized features and save your favorite desserts (for now you can login with any data since the app isn't yet connected to a authentication API backend, working on that).

- **Favorite Desserts**: Mark desserts as favorites and easily access them later. The app provides a seamless way to manage and view your favorite desserts (favorites will be lost when logoff, but when authentication API gets added in the future it will be solved).

## Installation

To run the Simple Desserts app on your iOS device or simulator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the `.xcodeproj` file.
3. Select a target device or simulator to run the app.
4. Build and run the app using the "Run" button in Xcode.

## Usage

Upon launching the app, you will be presented with a list of delicious desserts. You can scroll through the desserts, view their details, and explore their images. To unlock additional features, such as saving favorites, log in using your credentials.

To log in, tap on the "Login" button and enter your username and password. Once logged in, you can mark desserts as favorites by tapping the heart icon or any designated favorite action.

The app provides a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy to navigate, explore desserts, and manage your favorites.
